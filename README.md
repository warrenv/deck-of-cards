This is an exercise to create a shuffled deck of cards using javascript based on [this article](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-shuffle-an-array-with-vanilla-js/).

Tested on node 11 but anything >= 8 should work.

- Install packages and verify code:
```bash
  $ npm ci
  $ npm run lint
  $ npm run test
```

- Run the program:
```bash
  $ node -r esm index.js
```
